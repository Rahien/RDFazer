#+TITLE:RDFazer

* Introduction
RDFazer is a chrome browser plugin for tagging a website with RDFa concepts. It only tags the static page and does not store the content anywhere. It was concieved for taking an existing (static) webpage and tagging it with concepts from some taxonomy (e.g. the EC ESCO taxonomy). This page can then be stored elsewhere.

This code was written based on the nice input from:
- the tutorial provided by google :: e.g. https://developer.chrome.com/extensions/getstarted
- stackoverflow :: e.g. http://stackoverflow.com/questions/11684454/getting-the-source-html-of-the-current-page-from-chrome-extension
                   
This code makes heavy use of the [[https://github.com/timdown/rangy][rangy]] library, jquery and jquery ui.

RDFazer is currently a WIP and should not be used at all.
